    <h2>Lore</h2>
    <p>Pikachu was designed around the concept of electricity.[13] They are creatures that have short, yellow fur with brown markings covering their backs and parts of their lightning bolt-shaped tails. They have black-tipped, pointed ears and red circular pouches on their cheeks, which can spark with electricity.[14] They attack primarily by projecting electricity from their bodies at their targets.[15] Within the context of the franchise, Pikachu can transform, or "evolve," into a Raichu when exposed to a "Thunder Stone."[16] Pikachu was originally planned to have a second evolution called Gorochu, which was intended to be the evolved form of Raichu.[17][18] In Pokémon Gold and Silver, "Pichu" was introduced as an evolutionary predecessor to Pikachu.[19] In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, gender differences were introduced; since those games, female Pikachu have an indent at the end of their tails, giving the tail a heart-shaped appearance.

        Initially, both Pikachu and fellow Pokémon Clefairy were chosen to be lead characters for the franchise merchandising, with the latter as the primary mascot to make the early comic book series more "engaging". Production company OLM, Inc. suggested Pikachu as the mascot of the animated series after finding that Pikachu was popular amongst schoolchildren and could appeal to both boys and girls,[20][10] as well as their mothers. Pikachu resembled a familiar, intimate pet, and yellow is a primary color and easier for children to recognize from a distance. Additionally, the only other competing yellow mascot at the time was Winnie-the-Pooh.[21]
        
        Pikachu's design has evolved from its once-pudgy body to having a slimmer waist, straighter spine, and more defined face and neck; Sugimori has stated these design changes originated in the anime, making Pikachu easier to animate, and were adopted to the games for consistency.[22] "Fat Pikachu" was revisited in Pokémon Sword and Shield, where Pikachu received a Gigantamax Form resembling its original design.[23][24][25]</p>
